# discord-music-bot
This discord music bot was created by following the tutorial by Carberra Tutorials. His channel can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC13cYu7lec-oOcqQf5L-brg

This bot is locally hosted. I'm sure you could set it up to be hosted from a server if you so desired.

This bot requires OpenJDK version 13.0.2 or higher, it also requires the latest version of LavaLink.

Feel free to use this bot as you wish.

You must use a .env file with the changes I made. This allows you to avoid exposing your discord token if that is something you're worried about.

Create a file named ".env" without the quotes. Inside put "DISCORD_TOKEN=<YOUR TOKEN HERE>" without the quotes and replacing the content in the <> with your actual discord token found on your developer dashboard.
